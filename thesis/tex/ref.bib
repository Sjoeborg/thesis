We analyze the angular distribution of upward going atmospheric neutrino events in the IceCube-40 dataset for evidence of sterile neutrinos within these scenarios. Depending on how systematic uncertainties are handled, we find strong evidence for, or weak evidence against sterile neutrinos. We show that future IceCube data will definitively settle the issue.},

But the precise value of the deviation \$D \textbackslash equiv 1/2 - \textbackslash sin\^2 \textbackslash theta\_\{23\}\$ from maximality (if nonzero) needs to be known, being of great interest -- especially to builders of neutrino mass and mixing models. We quantitatively investigate in a three generation framework the feasibility of determining \$D\$ in a statistically significant manner from studies of the atmospheric \$\textbackslash nu\_\textbackslash mu,\textbackslash bar\textbackslash nu\_\textbackslash mu\$ survival probability including both vacuum oscillations and matter effects. We show how this determination will be sharpened by considering the up-down ratios of observed \$\textbackslash nu\_\textbackslash mu\$- and \$\textbackslash bar\textbackslash nu\_\textbackslash mu\$-induced events and the differences of these ratios in specified energy and zenith angle bins. We consider 1 Megaton year of exposure to a magnetized iron calorimeter such as the proposed INO detector ICAL, taking into account both energy and zenith angle resolution functions. The sensitivity of such an exposure and the dependence of the determination of \$D\$ on the concerned oscillation parameters are discussed in detail. The vital use of matter effects in fixing the octant of \$\textbackslash theta\_\{23\}\$ is highlighted.},

Furthermore, IceCube is the first experiment to constrain flavor-violating and nonuniversal couplings simultaneously. Hypothetical NSI are generically expected to arise due to the exchange of a new heavy mediator particle. Neutrinos propagating in matter scatter off fermions in the forward direction with negligible momentum transfer. Hence the study of the matter effect on neutrinos propagating in the Earth is sensitive to NSI independently of the energy scale of new physics. We present constraints on NSI obtained with an all-flavor event sample of atmospheric neutrinos based on three years of IceCube DeepCore data. The analysis uses neutrinos arriving from all directions, with reconstructed energies between 5.6 GeV and 100 GeV. We report constraints on the individual NSI coupling strengths considered singly, allowing for complex phases in the case of flavor-violating couplings. This demonstrates that IceCube is sensitive to the full NSI flavor structure at a level competitive with limits from the global analysis of all other experiments. In addition, we investigate a generalized matter potential, whose overall scale and flavor structure are also constrained.},

  abstract = {We study the constraints imposed by neutrino oscillation experiments on the minimal extensions of the Standard Model (SM) with \$n\_R\$ gauge singlet fermions ("right-handed neutrinos"), that can account for neutrino masses. We consider the most general coupling to SM fields of the new fields, in particular those that break lepton number and we do not assume any a priori hierarchy in the mass parameters. We proceed to analyze these models starting from the lowest level of complexity, defined by the number of extra fermionic degrees of freedom. The simplest choice that has enough free parameters in principle (i.e. two mass differences and two angles) to explain the confirmed solar and atmospheric oscillations corresponds to \$n\_R=1\$. This minimal choice is shown to be excluded by data. The next-to-minimal choice corresponds to \$n\_R=2\$. We perform a systematic study of the full parameter space in the limit of degenerate Majorana masses by requiring that at least two neutrino mass differences correspond to those established by solar and atmospheric oscillations. We identify several types of spectra that can fit long-baseline reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation data, but fail in explaining solar and/or atmospheric data. The only two solutions that survive are the expected seesaw and quasi-Dirac regions, for which we set lower and upper bounds respectively on the Majorana mass scale. Solar data from neutral current measurements provide essential information to constrain the quasi-Dirac region. The possibility to accommodate the LSND/MiniBoone and reactor anomalies, and the implications for neutrinoless double-beta decay and tritium beta decay are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will be a powerful tool for a variety of physics topics. The high-intensity proton beams provide a large neutrino flux, sampled by a near detector system consisting of a combination of capable precision detectors, and by the massive far detector system located deep underground. This configuration sets up DUNE as a machine for discovery, as it enables opportunities not only to perform precision neutrino measurements that may uncover deviations from the present three-flavor mixing paradigm, but also to discover new particles and unveil new interactions and symmetries beyond those predicted in the Standard Model (SM). Of the many potential beyond the Standard Model (BSM) topics DUNE will probe, this paper presents a selection of studies quantifying DUNE's sensitivities to sterile neutrino mixing, heavy neutral leptons, non-standard interactions, CPT symmetry violation, Lorentz invariance violation, neutrino trident production, dark matter from both beam induced and cosmogenic sources, baryon number violation, and other new physics topics that complement those at high-energy colliders and significantly extend the present reach.},

  abstract = {We study oscillations of the high energy atmospheric neutrinos in the Earth into sterile neutrinos with the eV-scale mass. The MSW resonance and parametric enhancement of the \$\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash nu\}\_\textbackslash mu\textbackslash to\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash nu\}\_s\$ oscillations lead to distortion of the zenith angle distribution of the muon-track events which can be observed by IceCube. Due to matter effect, the IceCube signal depends not only on the mixing element \$U\_\{\textbackslash mu 4\}\$ relevant for LSND and MiniBooNE but also on \$U\_\{\textbackslash tau 4\}\$ and the CP-violating phase \$\textbackslash delta\_\{24\}\$. We show that the case with \$U\_\{\textbackslash tau 4\} = \textbackslash delta\_\{24\} = 0\$ leads to the weakest IceCube signal and therefore should be used to bound \$U\_\{\textbackslash mu 4\}\$. We compute the zenith angle distributions of the \$\textbackslash nu\_\textbackslash mu-\$events for different energy intervals in the range (0.1 - 10) TeV and find that inclusion of the energy information (binning in energy) improves the sensitivity to \$\textbackslash nu\_s\$ drastically. We estimate that with already collected (during 3 - 4 years) IceCube statistics the bound \$|U\_\{\textbackslash mu 4\}|\^2 {$<$} 0.01\$ (\$99\textbackslash\%\$ C.L.) can be established and the mixing required by LSND and MiniBooNE can be excluded at \$(4 - 6) \textbackslash sigma\$ confidence level.},

  abstract = {We explore realizations of minimal flavour violation (MFV) for the lepton sector. We find that it can be realized within those seesaw models where a separation of the lepton number and lepton flavour violating scales can be achieved, such as type II and inverse seesaw models. We present in particular a simple implementation of the MFV hypothesis which differs in nature from those previously discussed. It allows to reconstruct the flavour structure of the model from the values of the light neutrino masses and mixing parameters, even in the presence of CP-violating phases. Experimentally reachable predictions for rare processes such as mu --{$>$} e gamma are given.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the physics reach of the IceCube neutrino detector when it will have collected a data set of order one million atmospheric neutrinos with energies in the 0.1 \textbackslash sim 10\^4 TeV range. The paper consists of three parts. We first demonstrate how to simulate the detector performance using relatively simple analytic methods. Because of the high energies of the neutrinos, their oscillations, propagation in the Earth and regeneration due to \textbackslash tau decay must be treated in a coherent way. We set up the formalism to do this and discuss the implications. In a final section we apply the methods developed to evaluate the potential of IceCube to study new physics beyond neutrino oscillations. Not surprisingly, because of the increased energy and statistics over present experiments, existing bounds on violations of the equivalence principle and of Lorentz invariance can be improved by over two orders of magnitude. The methods developed can be readily applied to other non-conventional physics associated with neutrinos.},

It is well known that the air density profiles in the polar and the tropical regions are different from the mid-latitude region. Also there are large seasonal variations in the polar region. In this extension, we use the NRLMSISE-00 global atmospheric model J. M. Picone, J. Geophys. Res. 107, SIA 15 (2002), replacing the U.S.-standard 1976 atmospheric model, which has no positional or seasonal variations. With the NRLMSISE-00 atmospheric model, we study the atmospheric neutrino flux at the polar and tropical regions with seasonal variations. The geomagnetic model international geomagnetic reference field (IGRF) we have used in our calculations seems accurate enough in the polar regions also. However, the polar and the equatorial regions are the two extremes in the IGRF model, and the magnetic field configurations are largely different from one another. Note that the equatorial region is also the tropical region generally. We study the effect of the geomagnetic field on the atmospheric neutrino flux in these extreme regions.},

Then we study the uncertainty of the calculated atmospheric neutrino flux summarizing the uncertainties of individual components of the simulation. The uncertainty of \$K\$-production in the interaction model is estimated by modifying FLUKA'97 and Fritiof 7.02 so that they also reproduce the atmospheric muon flux data correctly, and the calculation of the atmospheric neutrino flux with those modified interaction models. The uncertainties of the flux ratio and zenith angle dependence of the atmospheric neutrino flux are also studied.},

The fundamental observable in such detectors is the Cherenkov light produced by the transit through a medium of charged particles created in neutrino interactions. The amount of light emitted is proportional to the deposited energy, which is approximately equal to the neutrino energy for \$\textbackslash nu\_e\$ and \$\textbackslash nu\_\textbackslash mu\$ charged-current interactions and can be used to set a lower bound on neutrino energies and to measure neutrino spectra statistically in other channels. Here we describe methods and performance of reconstructing charged-particle energies and topologies from the observed Cherenkov light yield, including techniques to measure the energies of uncontained muon tracks, achieving average uncertainties in electromagnetic-equivalent deposited energy of \$\textbackslash sim 15\textbackslash\%\$ above 10 TeV.},

We assume those effects can be parametrized by an \$L\$-independent effective potential, \$V\_s=\textbackslash pm A\_s\$, experienced only by an intermediate, non-weakly-interacting (sterile) neutrino state which we assume participates in the oscillation, where \$+/-\$ corresponds to neutrino/antineutrino propagation. We discuss the mathematical framework in which such oscillations arise in detail, and derive the relevant oscillation probability as a function of the vacuum oscillation parameters \$\textbackslash Delta m\^2\$ and \$\textbackslash sin\^22\textbackslash theta\_\{\textbackslash mu e\}\$, and the matter effect parameter \$A\_s\$. We are able to successfully fit all three data sets, including the MiniBooNE low energy excess, with the following best-fit model parameters: \$\textbackslash Delta m\^2=0.47\$ eV\$\^2\$, \$\textbackslash sin\^22\textbackslash theta\_\{\textbackslash mu e\}=0.010\$, and \$A\_s=2.0\textbackslash times10\^\{-10\}\$ eV. The \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$-probability for the best fit corresponds to 21.6\%, to be compared to 6.8\% for a fit where \$A\_s\$ has been set to zero, corresponding to a (3+1) sterile neutrino oscillation model. We find that the compatibility between the three data sets corresponds to 17.4\%, to be compared to 2.3\% for \$A\_s=0\$. Finally, given the fit results, we examine consequences for reactor, solar, and atmospheric oscillations. For this paper, the presented model is empirically driven, but the results obtained can be directly used to investigate various phenomenological interpretations such as non-standard matter effects.},

  abstract = {The formalism of non-standard four-fermion interactions provides a convenient, model-independent way of parameterizing a wide class of ``new physics'' scenarios. In this article, we study the performance of reactor and superbeam neutrino experiments in the presence of such non-standard interactions (NSI). Due to interference between the standard and non-standard amplitudes, sizeable effects are to be expected if the NSI parameters are close to their current upper limits. We derive approximate formulas for the relevant oscillation probabilities including NSI, and show how the leading effects can be understood intuitively even without any calculations. We will present a classification of all possible NSI according to their impact on reactor and superbeam experiments, and it will turn out that these experiments are highly complementary in terms of their sensitivity to the non-standard parameters. The second part of the paper is devoted to detailed numerical simulations, which will demonstrate how a standard oscillation fit of the mixing angle theta-13 may fail if experimental data is affected by NSI. We find that for some non-standard terms, reactor and superbeam experiments would yield seemingly conflicting results, while in other cases, they may agree well with each other, but the resulting value for theta-13 could be far from the true value. This offset may be so large that the true theta-13 is even ruled out erroneously. In the last section of the paper, we demonstrate that reactor and superbeam data can actually establish the presence of non-standard interactions. Throughout our discussion, we pay special attention to the impact of the complex phases, and of the near detectors.},

  abstract = {Current neutrino experiments measure the neutrino mixing parameters with an unprecedented accuracy. The upcoming generation of experiments will be sensitive to subdominant effects that can give information on the unknown neutrino parameters: the Dirac CP-violating phase, the mass ordering and the \$\textbackslash theta\_\{23\}\$ octant. Determining the exact values of neutrino mass and mixing parameters is crucial to test neutrino models and flavor symmetries. In the first part of this review, we summarize the current status of neutrino oscillation parameters. We consider the most recent data from solar experiments and the atmospheric data from Super-Kamiokande, IceCube and ANTARES. We implement the data from the reactor experiments KamLAND, Daya Bay, RENO and Double Chooz as well as the long baseline data from MINOS, T2K and NOvA. If in addition to the standard interactions, neutrinos have subdominant Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) with matter, extracting the values of these parameters will suffer from new degeneracies. We review such effects and formulate the conditions on the NSI parameters under which the precision measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters can be distorted. Like standard weak interactions, NSI can be categorized into Charged and Neutral Current NSI. Our focus will be on NC NSI since it is possible to build a class of models giving rise to sizeable NC NSI with effects on neutrino oscillations. These models are based on new \$U(1)\$ gauge symmetry with a boson of mass \$\textbackslash lesssim 10\$ MeV. The UV complete model should be electroweak invariant which implies that along with neutrinos, charged fermions acquire new interactions on which there are strong bounds. We enumerate the bounds that exist on such models and show that it is possible to build viable models avoiding all the bounds. We review methods to test these models and suggest approaches to break the degeneracies caused by NSI.},

  abstract = {Our herein described combined analysis of the latest neutrino oscillation data presented at the Neutrino2020 conference shows that previous hints for the neutrino mass ordering have significantly decreased, and normal ordering (NO) is favored only at the 1.6σ level. Combined with the χ2 map provided by Super-Kamiokande for their atmospheric neutrino data analysis the hint for NO is at 2.7σ. The CP conserving value δCP = 180° is within 0.6σ of the global best fit point. Only if we restrict to inverted mass ordering, CP violation is favored at the ∼ 3σ level. We discuss the origin of these results — which are driven by the new data from the T2K and NOvA long-baseline experiments —, and the relevance of the LBL-reactor oscillation frequency complementarity. The previous 2.2σ tension in ∆m221 preferred by KamLAND and solar experiments is also reduced to the 1.1σ level after the inclusion of the latest Super-Kamiokande solar neutrino results. Finally we present updated allowed ranges for the oscillation parameters and for the leptonic Jarlskog determinant from the global analysis.},

With its unprecedented statistical sample of low-energy atmospheric neutrinos, PINGU will have highly competitive sensitivity to \$\textbackslash nu\_\{\textbackslash mu\}\$ disappearance, the \$\textbackslash theta\_\{23\}\$ octant, and maximal mixing, will make the world's best \$\textbackslash nu\_\{\textbackslash tau\}\$ appearance measurement, allowing a unique probe of the unitarity of the PMNS mixing matrix, and will be able to distinguish the neutrino mass ordering at \$3\textbackslash sigma\$ significance with less than 4 years of data. PINGU can also extend the indirect search for solar WIMP dark matter complimentary to the on-going and planned direct dark matter experiments. At the lower end of the energy range, PINGU may use neutrino tomography to directly probe the composition of the Earth's core. With its increased module density, PINGU will improve IceCube's sensitivity to galactic supernova neutrino bursts and enable it to extract the neutrino energy spectral shape.},

We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$\textbackslash Omega\_c h\^2 = 0.120\textbackslash pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$\textbackslash Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.0224\textbackslash pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$\textbackslash tau = 0.054\textbackslash pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100\textbackslash theta\_*=1.0411\textbackslash pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$\textbackslash Omega\_m = 0.315\textbackslash pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2–4\%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented.},

  abstract = {Non-standard interactions in the propagation of neutrinos in matter can lead to significant deviations from expectations within the standard neutrino oscillation framework and atmospheric neutrino detectors have been considered to set constraints. However, most previous works have focused on relatively low-energy atmospheric neutrino data. Here, we consider the one-year high-energy through-going muon data in IceCube, which has been already used to search for light sterile neutrinos, to constrain new interactions in the \$\textbackslash mu\textbackslash tau\$-sector. In our analysis we include several systematic uncertainties on both, the atmospheric neutrino flux and on the detector properties, which are accounted for via nuisance parameters. After considering different primary cosmic-ray spectra and hadronic interaction models, we obtain the most stringent bound on the off-diagonal \$\textbackslash varepsilon\_\{\textbackslash mu \textbackslash tau\}\$ parameter to date, with the 90\textbackslash\% credible interval given by \$-6.0 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-3\} {$<$} \textbackslash varepsilon\_\{\textbackslash mu \textbackslash tau\} {$<$} 5.4 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-3\}\$. In addition, we also estimate the expected sensitivity after 10\textasciitilde years of collected data in IceCube and study the precision at which non-standard parameters could be determined for the case of \$\textbackslash varepsilon\_\{\textbackslash mu \textbackslash tau\}\$ near its current bound.},

  abstract = {The IceCube neutrino observatory in operation at the South Pole, Antarctica, comprises three distinct components: a large buried array for ultrahigh energy neutrino detection, a surface air shower array, and a new buried component called DeepCore. DeepCore was designed to lower the IceCube neutrino energy threshold by over an order of magnitude, to energies as low as about 10 GeV. DeepCore is situated primarily 2100 m below the surface of the icecap at the South Pole, at the bottom center of the existing IceCube array, and began taking physics data in May 2010. Its location takes advantage of the exceptionally clear ice at those depths and allows it to use the surrounding IceCube detector as a highly efficient active veto against the principal background of downward-going muons produced in cosmic-ray air showers. DeepCore has a module density roughly five times higher than that of the standard IceCube array, and uses photomultiplier tubes with a new photocathode featuring a quantum efficiency about 35\% higher than standard IceCube PMTs. Taken together, these features of DeepCore will increase IceCube's sensitivity to neutrinos from WIMP dark matter annihilations, atmospheric neutrino oscillations, galactic supernova neutrinos, and point sources of neutrinos in the northern and southern skies. In this paper we describe the design and initial performance of DeepCore.},

  abstract = {We present a search for a light sterile neutrino using three years of atmospheric neutrino data from the DeepCore detector in the energy range of approximately \$10-60\textasciitilde\$GeV. DeepCore is the low-energy sub-array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The standard three-neutrino paradigm can be probed by adding an additional light (\$\textbackslash Delta m\_\{41\}\^2 \textbackslash sim 1 \textbackslash mathrm\{\textbackslash{} eV\^2\}\$) sterile neutrino. Sterile neutrinos do not interact through the standard weak interaction, and therefore cannot be directly detected. However, their mixing with the three active neutrino states leaves an imprint on the standard atmospheric neutrino oscillations for energies below 100 GeV. A search for such mixing via muon neutrino disappearance is presented here. The data are found to be consistent with the standard three neutrino hypothesis. Therefore we derive limits on the mixing matrix elements at the level of \$|U\_\{\textbackslash mu4\}|\^2 {$<$} 0.11 \$ and \$|U\_\{\textbackslash tau4\}|\^2 {$<$} 0.15 \$ (90\% C.L.) for the sterile neutrino mass splitting \$\textbackslash Delta m\_\{41\}\^2 = 1.0\$ eV\$\^2\$.},
