\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conc}
TBD
% TODO Conclusion:
% We produced the conclusion plots, and ic is insensitive to any impact if th34.
% NSI: which detector is more sensitive? Add paragraph on what parameters that PINGU can measure (in future tense). Write what constrain which parameters?
% Include effect on system uncertainty on PINGU. Compare with other measurements. Write from fig 5.7 that let Eem are anti-correlated, while no significant correlation can be seen from emt-emt, emt-eet.
% Reference papers on PINGU, NSI. And NSI from Llong baseline experiments. Include reference to DUNE from ESS paper with S+T+M.
