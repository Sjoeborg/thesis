Look up "one mass scale dominance"

We can drop the lowest E bins, they are irrelevant for our resonance analysis, and only slow down simulations.
My honda fluxes only include the "conventional fluxes". There are two additional parts: astrophysical and prompt. IC2020 gives the simulates event rates broken down per fluxn type. I can use this to extract a constant per bin to include the contributions from these as well.
Theta34 is the least Â´constrained parameter because it mediates tau and sterile, and we are primarily loooking at the mu flux by studying tracks. Why are IC not analyzing showers? Look this up!

Showers are due to the Z-boson, which doesn't interact with the sterile neutrino. We might be abe to exploit this and study how shower data shows info about sterile.
