U_e1, U_e, U_e3 wrong in graph. UM matrix has the correct entrie, but the graph is wrong. 
abs(Um3)^ is wrong, (should be close to 0.5).
Plot Uei, Uti for loewr energies too. 

theta_34 i wierd, is there a relationhip beteen then theta4 = 0.5 and theta34=dicontinuity?

where is theta12? Is something with the 3 eigenvalue wrong?

Plot the eigenvalue on log-log ccale (y-sclae log).
Plot with both case (theta34 = 0 and theta34=theta4).

IC on Tueday?
Read info on how IC collect event on IC ebite. Understand showers and track.

Track = mu
shower = e, t, NC

NC:
nu + nucleon = nu+nucleon goes to hadronic shower.

Check pDG on how muons lose energy in matter (cherenkov radiation)
electron lose energy by bremsstrahlung (photon)

we will check previous papers and lok at references to see here people have gotten theis cross section and fluxes.
