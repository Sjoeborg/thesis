Convert all units to eV. This is the 1.27 factor in the sine term. For numerical L -> L/1.27 or L*1.27
Figure out what L/E gives pi/2 for a given dm? Maximal oscillation

Understand the probabilities. Change L to meaningful value (earth diameter)
Icecube has 100 GeV-TeV
To check 3 neutrino matter oscillation. Use constant matter density to diagonalize the Hamiltonian for 2d. dm_31 only relevant. Set other dm_12 to 0, and theta_12 to 0 in 3d case to turn it into 2d.

which dm corresponds to which baseline? Figure out connection between dm's and the baseline/energy
12: solar sector
31: connection between solar and atm
32: atm sector 
Upgrade to 4 generations

5 GeV Energy for earth gives resonance in earth. Look into this.
