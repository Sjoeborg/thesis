Q: When diagonalizing the hamiltonian , are we assuming unitarity? Doesss non-unitarity of U break this?

Thought on fig6:
in Pms (s_34): doubling s_24 halves P_ms (from black to green). Switching on s_34 strongly supressses P_ms (black to red), and doubling this almost removes P (red to blue). ONLY TRUE AT RESOANCE. Away from resonance, we get the "intuitive" behaviour with double angle -> double P. Moreover, away from resonance we see the s_34 effect almost completely disappearing (no difference between blue,green and red,black).

in P_mt(c_34): Independent on s_24 (no difference between black and green), but is depending non-linearily (cf P_ms) on s_34. This is not only true for the resonance peak, but for the whole graph (cf Pms).

The resonance energy needs to match with the energy at which the mixing angle peaks.

In 3 gen case, they show a merging point at 5 GeV, where we might have some interesting effects in that area? but our resonance is at 2 TeV.

dm_41 IC sensetive
people ignore th_34 
do series expansions to get dm_41?
Plot analytic result (from diagonalizing) with numerical ones

sum P = 1 => resonance in mt and ms gives pmm = 0.


set th_14 = 0. only interested in dm_41, th_24, t_34. use mathematica to give results on only these parameters (set others to zero one at a time). Compare this with the full setup. Do this numerically as well. Might help mathematica to set some terms to 0.
expand in t_24,t_34 and write down expressions in these.
read about series expansion of parameter that resonates.


check eigenvals are in correct order!
plot H_M eigenval and th_M as func of energy. th_M should be maximal (45 deg) for some E_res
Check mathilde references. She studied matter effects + neutrino absorption for IC.
Read through Smirnov completely
Parametrization is the meaning we give to the mxiing angles. Diff param => diff theta

Can i give a nice form of the 4x4 u matrix by setting some params ==0?

Study two cases in mathematica:
    Case1: theta_34=0, theta_24!=0
    case2:theta_24=theta_34
Cross check with numerical, espacially around resonance (disregard wiggles).
