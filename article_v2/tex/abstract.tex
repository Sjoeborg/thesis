We consider interactions beyond the Standard Model, possibly stemming from a higher-order theory.
We show how the parameters of these Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) can modify the oscillation probabilities and within which energy range we expect to discern this signal.
We use data from and simulate event counts in two Cherenkov detectors: IceCube and DeepCore. Moreover, we generate data and simulate a proposed upgrade of the DeepCore detector: PINGU. 

We obtain stringent bounds on the NSI parameters and compare those to previous results in literature. We show that PINGU is expected to narrow the bound further 
on $\emt$, especially by considering a joint analysis with IceCube and DeepCore. Finally, we see that an anti-correlation between 
$\eem$ and $\eet$ at probability level was propagated down to event level, which we expect to be observable by PINGU.
